# Normalization Steps

## First Normal Form (1NF)
- All attributes have atomic values.
- No repeating groups.

## Second Normal Form (2NF)
- All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
- Each table has a single-column primary key, so no partial dependencies.

## Third Normal Form (3NF)
- No transitive dependencies.
- All non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.

**Conclusion**: Schema is in 3NF.
